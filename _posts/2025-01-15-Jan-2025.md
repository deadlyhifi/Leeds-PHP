# The Talks

## OpenAPI for Web Developers - Lorna Mitchell

> APIs are at the heart of modern application development, and OpenAPI is a powerful tool to streamline your API development lifecycle. In this talk, we’ll explore how OpenAPI can enhance your projects and how an OpenAPI description evolves through the build process to power up different aspects of your project. Get hands-on examples of the cool tools to use with OpenAPI to transform the API descriptions, produce documentation or client SDKs, or mock up the API for testing. With practical tips and pointers to further resources, this session is perfect for anyone using APIs who wants to make them just a little bit better. Come along and get ready to take the next step in your API journey.
