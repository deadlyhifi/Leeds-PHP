# The Talks

## Advent of Code Social


> Bring your laptop and join us for our advent of code event! We'll pair up (or you can work independently if you wish) and go through some of the challenges in PHP or in your preferred language. We'll have several of Santa's helpers around to help you out with the challenges, including David Betterdrige, James Holden, Alan Lapington & Irene Sarigu

> "The Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other." { Taken from the Advent of Code website}
