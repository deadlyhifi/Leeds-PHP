# The Talks

## Leverage the power of Terraform with existing cloud infrastructure

### Alan Lapington

> In this talk we'll delve into the capabilities of 'terraform import', and discover how to leverage the power of infrastructure-as-code without needing to rebuild all of your infrastructure from scratch.
<hr/>


## Real Time Applications with LaravelPHP

### Harry Messenger

> Modern web applications feel like living, breathing entities sometimes. Part of that is the ability for them to respond in real-time to events and reach out to users to pass on critical information. Harry Messenger shares with us some background of how this phenomenon came to be as well as a demonstration of how we can leverage PHP and Laravel to achieve this in our own applications.
