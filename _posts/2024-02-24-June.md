# The Talks

## What makes a good developer?

### Syed Ali

> What makes a good developer? Where developers have to do more than just write code, what actually makes a good developer? In this talk, I want to attempt to answer that question by looking at what relationships a developer has to manage. Looking at their needs, and how we can best manage them, whilst satisfying our own working needs.
