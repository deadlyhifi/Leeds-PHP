# The Talks

## Get the Full Gossip on ChatGPT and Copilot: Communications in the Age of AI - Bill Ayers

> Everybody's heard about ChatGPT, based on the latest GPT-4 AI models. With its human-like and school homework friendly text generation, you might be wondering what it all means, and where it's all going. Who or what is OpenAI, and why is Microsoft investing so heavily in it? In this overview we'll see how natural language processing (NLP), and AI in general, has changed in the last few years, especially with the latest generative models based on transformers trained on mind-bogglingly large datasets. And I'll try to answer the question of whether ChatGPT is sentient, or likely to be in the future. I'll lift the curtain and show you what's really going on behind the scenes. Don't worry if AI is still all a bit of a mystery. For this talk, attention is all you need.
